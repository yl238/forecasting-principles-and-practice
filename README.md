# Forecasting Principles and Practice
Notes and Python code for the third edition of the book ["Forecasting: Principles and Practice"](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos.

In the book the code examples are in R. Here we make use of the Python libraries[statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysis. Also, because [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is the coolest thing in visualisation, we will use the Python implementation of `ggplot2` [plotnine](https://plotnine.org/) to create our figures whenever possible.

Nowadays it's nearly impossible to do something nobody has done before, so the repository https://github.com/zgana/fpp3-python-readalong has been extremely helpful in providing data and code for some of the more complicated plots.

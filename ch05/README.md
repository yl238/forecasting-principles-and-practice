# Chapter 5 The forecaster's toolbox
In this chapter, we discuss some general tools that are useful for many different forecasting situations. We will describe some benchmark forecasting methods, procedures for checking whether a forecasting method has adequately utilised the available information, techniques for computing prediction intervals, and methods for evaluating forecast accuracy.

Each of the tools discussed in this chapter will be used repeatedly in subsequent chapters as we develop and explore a range of forecasting methods.

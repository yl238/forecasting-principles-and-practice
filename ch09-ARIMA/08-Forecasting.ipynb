    "How are forecasts from ARIMA models obtained? They can be calculated using the following three steps:\n",
    "1. Expand the ARIMA equation so that $y_t$ is on the left hand side and all the other terms are on the RHS.\n",
    "2. Rewrite the equation by replacing $t$ with $T+h$.\n",
    "3. On the RHS of the equation, replace future observations with their forecasts, future errors with zero, and past errors with the corresponding residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with $h=1$, these steps are then repeated for $h=2, 3, \\ldots$ until all forecasts have been calculated. \n",
